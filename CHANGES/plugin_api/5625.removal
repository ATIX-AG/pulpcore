models.RepositoryVersion.create() is no longer available, it has been replaced by {repository instance}.new_version().

The convention for sync is that it will now be performed by POSTing to {repo_href}/sync/ remote={remote_href} instead of by POSTING to {remote_href}/sync/ repository={repo_href}. The latter will break due to becoming a typed resource, so plugins will need to adjust their code for the former convention.

Make repositories "typed". Plugin writers need to subclass the Repository model, viewset, and serializer, as well as the RepositoryVersion viewset (just the viewset). They should also remove the /sync/ endpoint from their remote viewset and place it on the repository viewset.
