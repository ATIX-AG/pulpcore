Renamed the Content.repo_key to be Content.repo_unit_key. Also the calling of `RemoveDuplicates`
no longer happens in `RepositoryVersion.add_content` and instead is intended for plugins to call
from `Repository.finalize_new_version(new_version)`. Also the `pulpcore.plugin.RemoveDuplicates`
Stage was removed.
