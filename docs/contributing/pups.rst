PUPs
====

:term:`PUP` stands for "Pulp Update Proposal", and are the documents that specify process changes
for the Pulp project and community. All approved PUPs live in the `PUP repository
<https://github.com/pulp/pups/>`_.

`PUP-1 <https://github.com/pulp/pups/blob/master/pup-0001.md>`_ defines the PUP process itself.

All approved, rejected, and abandoned PUPs are tracked in the `PUP index
<https://github.com/pulp/pups/blob/master/README.md>`_
